            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Abhishek Sharma</span> from{" "}
            <span className="purple">Jaipur, India</span>.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Fitpage</strong>, a fitness tech startup.
            <br />
            I have completed my <strong>B.Tech in Computer Science</strong> from{" "}
            <strong>BIT Bangalore</strong>.
            <br /><br />
            ðŸ’¼ <strong>Software Development Intern @ Fitpage</strong>
            <br />
            During my internship, I worked on a live fitness platform, contributing to features across the tech stack.
            I gained hands-on experience with a modern web development stack including{" "}
            <strong>Next.js</strong> for frontend, <strong>NestJS</strong> for backend services and{" "}
            <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> as the database.
            <br />
            I collaborated closely with senior engineers, followed agile workflows, and learned the dynamics of working in a fast-paced startup environment.
            <br /><br />
            Apart from coding, here are a few activities I enjoy:
